/**
 * This release should finally cleanup the entire type interface and others
 * logic. Also, it should bring name-based member and body elaboration.
 * The elaboration grouping logic should be reviewed and documented.
 *
 * Closed lookups need to be performed like C++-style overload resolution.
 *
 * Also, operator overloading must result in shadowing alternatives in closed
 * lookups as a first filter rule on multiple matches.
 *
 * Note to self: I need to review shadowing rules. It could be that I need to
 *  maintain shadow maps.
